General:
  #======================================================================#
  # CheckforUpdates: true
  # - Setting this to false will stop ItemJoin from checking for updates 
  #   and notifying you if an update has been found upon starting the 
  #   server, or reloading the server.
  CheckforUpdates: true
  #======================================================================#
  #
  #======================================================================#
  # Metrics-Logging: true
  # - This should always be kept true, this simply allows ItemJoin to 
  #   anonymously send data of your item count, server version, most 
  #   used dependencies, java version, etc. 
  #
  # - A way to think of this as it being a statistics page. 
  #   If you wish to not be included set this to false. 
  #
  # - This tool will be really useful in allowing me to increase the 
  #   quality of the ItemJoin updates as well as supported Minecraft 
  #   Versions. You can see the ItemJoin stats page here; 
  #   ==> https://bstats.org/plugin/bukkit/ItemJoin
  Metrics-Logging: true
  #======================================================================#
  #
  #======================================================================#
  # Log-Commands: true
  # - Setting this to false will stop the console from logging any of 
  #   the commands that are executed from ItemJoin item
  Log-Commands: true
  #======================================================================#
  #
  #======================================================================#
  # Debugging: false
  # - Setting this to true may help identify a bug you found when 
  #   reporting it to the developer, it creates more detailed logs and 
  #   outputs in the console window for debugging later on. 
  #
  # - It is recommended to keep this false unless you are experiencing 
  #   issues with ItemJoin and need help.
  Debugging: false

# |              These settings are optional as a database file is generated by default          | #
# |                          or you can set up MySQL database connections.                       | #

# +----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+ #
Database:
  #======================================================================#
  # MySQL: false
  # - When setting this to true, a MySQL database will be used 
  #   (and required) for ItemJoin. When set to false, a local .db file 
  #   which is located in the ItemJoin folder will be used.
  MySQL: false
  #======================================================================#
  #
  #======================================================================#
  # host: 'localhost'
  # - The hostname of your MySQL database. Use the credentials 
  #   provided by your MySQL provider.
  host: 'localhost'
  #======================================================================#
  #
  #======================================================================#
  # port: 3306
  # - The port of your MySQL database. 
  #
  # - Port 3306 is the standard port and is normally used. 
  #
  # - If you can't connect with this port, and you can't find any 
  #   clues about the port the database is using, you should contact 
  #   your service provider, to ask for the port.
  port: 3306
  #======================================================================#
  #
  #======================================================================#
  # table: 'database_name'
  # - The name of the table (directory), that will be created. 
  #
  # - You can call database_name whatever you want, as long as 
  #   it is a unique table name.
  table: 'database_name'
  #======================================================================#
  #
  #======================================================================#
  # user: 'root'
  # - The username of the database. Use the credentials 
  #   provided by your MySQL provider.
  user: 'root'
  #======================================================================#
  #
  #======================================================================#
  # pass: 'password'
  # - The password of your MySQL database.

# +----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+ #
Settings:
  #======================================================================#
  # HeldItem-Slot: DISABLED
  # - This works in a fairly simple way, this option is meant for you 
  #   to be able to define what slot you want the player that logs in 
  #   and changes worlds to be selected on.
  #
  # - So say you define slot 3 to be what you want the players to be 
  #   selected on when joining and switching worlds this will be the 
  #   slot selected, usually great to use if you have a special item 
  #   in that slot.
  #
  # - So simply put, this option forces the players to have this
  #   specific slot as their selected slot. You may only define slots 0-8,
  #   as you only have 9 slots in your hot-bar.
  #  
  # - If you wish for it to be disabled, set it to None
  HeldItem-Slot: DISABLED
  #======================================================================#
  #
  #======================================================================#
  # HeldItem-Triggers: JOIN, WORLD-SWITCH
  # - ????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
  #   ????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
  #   ????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
  HeldItem-Triggers: JOIN, WORLD-SWITCH
  #======================================================================#
  #
  #======================================================================#
  # DataTags: true
  # - Setting this from true to false or vice versa will require you to
  #   fully clear the player's inventory, old items will break.
  #
  # - When this is set to true ItemJoin will give items NBTTags to help
  #   identify them as ItemJoin items, if this is set to false it will
  #   simply define it within the items name in a way that
  #   you won't see it.
  #
  # - Keeping this set to true will allow some ItemJoin features to work
  #   better so it is best to keep this set to true by default.
  #
  # - If you don't understand what this does please do not touch it,
  #   there should be no change when setting this to false that
  #   you would notice.
  DataTags: true

# |                                  is/are applied to certain players.                          | #

# +----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+ #
Permissions:
  #======================================================================#
  # Obtain-Items: false
  # - Setting this to false will allow all players to get any and all 
  #   items regardless of what permissions they have. 
  #
  # - However, setting this to true will enable ItemJoin 
  #   permissions for items.
  Obtain-Items: false
  #======================================================================#
  #
  #======================================================================#
  # Obtain-Items-OP: false
  # - Setting this to true will require ops to have each item's 
  #   permissions in order to receive them, rather than getting 
  #   all items by default. 
  #
  # - Keeping this false will allow ops to bypass all Item permissions
  #   and receive every item.
  Obtain-Items-OP: false
  #======================================================================#
  #
  #======================================================================#
  # Commands-Get: false
  # - Setting this to true will require players to have the item's 
  #   permission when receiving an item that is being given via 
  #   ===> /itemjoin get 
  #
  # - If the player lacks the specific item's permission, an error message
  #   will be sent to both parties that yourself or the specified is 
  #   lacking the permission. 
  #
  # - Obviously depending on which of the two commands are executed. 
  #
  # - Note this does not give or revoke any permissions for a player to 
  #   run this command, that is still linked to the 
  #   ===> itemjoin.get | and  ===>itemjoin.get.others | permission nodes
  Commands-Get: false
  #======================================================================#
  #
  #======================================================================#
  # Commands-OP: false
  # - Setting this to true will require ops to have each commands 
  #   permissions or 
  #         ===>itemjoin.all             ===>itemjoin.* 
  #   in order to use each command.
  #
  #  |- itemjoin.
  #  |  reload, updates, autoupdate, creator, purge, save, get, get.others, 
  #  |  remove, remove.others, enable, enable.others, disable, 
  #  |  disable.others, list 
  # - Are no longer given to Opped players by default, you will now have
  #   to set Commands-OP in the config.yml to false to allow ops to get 
  #   these commands by default (however this is the default selected 
  #   setting, setting it to true will require ops to be 
  #   given these permissions).
  #
  # - Keeping this false will allow ops to execute the following commands
  #   by default, without permissions.
  #  |- itemjoin.
  #  |  reload, updates, autoupdate, creator, purge, save, get, get.others,
  #  |  remove, remove.others, enable, enable.others, disable, 
  #  |  disable.others, list
  Commands-OP: false
  #======================================================================#
  #
  #======================================================================#
  # Movement-Bypass: false
  # - Setting this to true will enable the use of the 
  #   ===> itemjoin.bypass.inventorymodify permission node. 
  #
  # - If this is kept false simply giving the player the permission node 
  #   will not allow them to bypass the inventory modification itemflag.
  #
  # - This was implemented because some server owners were using the * 
  #   permission node which would force the server to give the player 
  #   every single permission node on the server...
  Movement-Bypass: false

Clear-Items:
  #======================================================================#
  # Type: ItemJoin
  # - There are two options for this, either ItemJoin or All. 
  #
  # - ItemJoin - Specifies only ItemJoin items to be the items cleared.
  #
  # - All - Specifies any item within the player's inventory to be cleared.
  Type: ITEMJOIN
  #======================================================================#
  #
  #======================================================================#
  # Delay-Tick: 2
  # - This is the time in half-seconds before the items will be cleared 
  #   from the player's inventory. This is useful to combat other plugins 
  #   giving after the inventory is cleared or restoring a 
  #   players inventory.
  #
  # - If this is set equal to or higher than the items-Delay value in 
  #   the items.yml it will automatically increase the items-Delay by one 
  #   half-second to prevent the items from being removed 
  #   after they are given
  Delay-Tick: 2
  #======================================================================#
  #
  #======================================================================#
  # Join: DISABL
  # - Setting this to true will either clear All Items or Only ItemJoin 
  #   items upon joining the server, depending on what the Clear-Items 
  #   option is set to do. 
  #
  # - Also, instead of setting this to true you can define specific 
  #   worlds that you wish to clear in if a player joins within that world.
  #
  # - Example of specific worlds defined: 
  #   ===> Join: world, world_nether, world_the_en
  Join: DISABLED
  #======================================================================#
  #
  #======================================================================#
  # World-Switch: DISABLED
  # - Setting this to true will either clear All Items or Only ItemJoin 
  #   items upon switching to a different world, depending on what the 
  #   Clear-Items option is set to do. 
  #
  # - Also, instead of setting this to true you can define specific 
  #   worlds that you wish to clear in if a player switches to that 
  #   specific world(s).
  #
  # - Example of specific worlds defined:
  #   ===> World-Switch: world, world_nether, world_the_en
  World-Switch: DISABLED
  #======================================================================#
  #
  #======================================================================#
  # Region-Enter: DISABLED
  # - Setting this to true will either clear All Items or Only ItemJoin 
  #   items upon entering a region, depending on what the 
  #   Clear-Items option is set to do.
  #
  # - Also, instead of setting this to true you can define specific 
  #   regions that you wish to clear in if a player enters that 
  #   specific region(s).
  #
  # - Example of specific worlds defined:
  #   ===> Region-Enter: region1, region2
